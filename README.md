# AI-Driven-Parking-Space-Detection-Using-CNN
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automate the detection of free parking spaces. By leveraging advanced image recognition techniques, the model is trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset to accurately identify vacant spots in various parking environments.
