# AI-Driven-Parking-Space-Detection-Using-CNN
This project develops a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automate the detection of free parking spaces. By leveraging advanced image recognition techniques, the model is trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset to accurately identify vacant spots in various parking environments. The project is structured into three primary phases:

Preparation and Preprocessing: Importing essential libraries and linking to the dataset, setting the groundwork for model development.
Model Development: Creating, training, and testing the CNN model to ensure it learns the nuances of recognizing free vs. occupied parking spaces.
Real-world Application: Demonstrating the model's effectiveness on new, unseen images to validate its practical applicability in real-time parking management systems.
This AI-driven solution aims to streamline parking management and improve user experience by providing accurate, real-time information on parking availability, potentially integrating with smart city infrastructure to alleviate urban congestion and maximize space utilization.
